    <h1>PGP</h1>
  </header>
  <p><em>Pretty Good Privacy</em> or PGP is a system to help solve two problems in the digital world:
  <ol>
    <li>Privacy &rarr; making sure data is only read by the intended recipients</li>
    <li>Authenticity &rarr; making sure data comes from who it say it comes from</li>
  </ol>

  PGP helps with these by providing users with keys that can encrypt and digitally sign data. Each user generates a public and private key, the public one is make public and the private one is kept secret by the owner.
  Signatures made with the private key can be verified with the public key.
  Encryption created with the public key can only be unlocked with the private key.
  </p>
  
  <p>For example, if you sent me an email encrypted with <a href="/pubkey.txt">my public key</a>, only I would be able to read it.
  I sent you a response signed with my private key, you could then verify it came from me with my public key. 
  </p>

  <h2>Why this matters</h2>
  <p>Privacy is a fundamental right and authenticity is very valuble. Even if you have nothing to hide, there should be an expectation that no one should read your data without permission. 
  If you feel the same way as I do, try out PGP! <a href="https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/index.html" title="The free software foundation guide to email self-defense/encryption">This is a good starting resource.</a> 


  <h2>Key Signing</h2>
  <p>If you've followed that resource and you'd like me to sign your key, send me an <a href="mailto:isaac.c.feldman.23@dartmouth.edu" title="send me an email">email</a> and I'd be happy to!</p>
