    <strong>What is it called when your senses disagree?</strong> <br>
    When you see blue but feel red?<br>
    When you feel rhythm but hear no music? <br>
    When you hear rain hit the pavemen, steeping in the cracks<br>
    and it smells like tea?<br>
    <br>
    What is it called when you touch the softness of their skin <br>
    but only feek the roughness of you own fingertips?<br>
    When you open your eyes wider in the dark, but the view gets blacker?<br>
    When you taste smoke in the air long before a fire starts?<br>
    When you hear a song but when you join in coughs break out?<br>
    <br>
    Mulling in sensual confusion is human,<br>
    reconciling it is for poets,<br>
    and solving it, fools.<br>
